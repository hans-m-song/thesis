\section{PRISM Games}

PRISM is a probabilistic model checker that enables automatic verification of systems with stochastic behaviour and provides a property checker for verifying specific properties \cite{prism}. PRISM-games is an extension to prism that adds support for turn based or concurrent multi-player games \cite{prismgames}. 

Abstracting the auction to a constant in the proposed model, the game may be modelled in a discrete time Markov chain using trade intervals and block time as signals for transitions. Furthermore, applying a discount factor and threshold ensures the number of states can be reduced to a finite set. In doing so, the game can then be modelled in PRISM-games in an attempt to verify the presence of a Nash equilibrium.
