%         - state diagram generator \\
%     why you chose to collect specific data \\
%     how this data will help you to answer your research questions \\
%     why you chose the approach you went with. \\

% \todo[inline]{
%     specify the data you collected and how it was were prepared for analysis \\
%     describe the data analysis (e.g. define the type of statistical test that was applied to the data) \\
%     describe the outcome of the analysis \\
